  <h2>Security and Insecurity</h2>
  <h3>#TechWorldProblems</h3>
  <h4>12-14-2014</h4>
    <p>
      The tech world is an ever-expanding universe of ideas, products, people and money.  Unfortunately, when you get all of those things together, you are bound to get some issues that can threaten the industry.  One of those issues is security.  As people and programs become more and more technologically advanced, the technical infrastructure of our country and our world become more and more vulnerable.  From identity theft to credit card hacking to complete website infiltration, tech companies (and all sorts of companies, for that matter) are investing more money than ever in trying to keep their companies and assets secure.  While there are several different types of security that companies are concerning themselves with, including <strong>personnel security</strong> (security for their employees) and <strong>physical security</strong> (security for the facilities of their company), the one that I am going to discuss is <strong>information security</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A major study done by the <em>Securitas</em> agency in 2012 indicated the the biggest challenge for most companies, regardless of their size, is how to protect their proprietary information.  Before the technology era, this simply meant ensuring that all their information was securely locked away somewhere, usually either in a locked safe or a company-owned safety deposit box.  In this current era of vast technology, however, it is not so simple to keep your information secure.  A company's information now extends to everything contained in the company's computers and related tech systems.  The threats can come from anywhere, as well.  Competitors, hackers and even foreign espionage efforts can all threaten information systems, and companies are having a difficult time staying ahead of the threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a recent survey done by <em>Radware</em>, some 19% of the 340 tech executives interviewed described the attacks against their companies as "constant", with about 15% claiming the attacks lasted more than one month.  This was the first time in the four years that <em>Radware</em> has done the survey that so many responders claimed the attacks were constant, which shows either a slower reaction to the attacks or a more undetectable and undefeatable approach from the attackers.  While companies seemed to be equally concerned with the "usual" methods of attack, such as phishing, fraud, IP theft and virus damage, distributed denial of service attacks (or DDoS) were at the top of the list of threats that IT managers were the most concerned about.  So what are DDoS attacks?
    </p>
    <p>
      Put simply, a DDoS attack is an attempt to make a machine or a network resource unavailable to its intended users.  While the motives for such an attack can vary, they generally consist of efforts to interrupt or suspend services of a host connected to the internet, either temporarily or indefinitely.  A common method of undertaking such an attack is to overload a company's servers by saturating the target machine or network with external communication requests so that it cannot respond to legitimate web traffic.  These types of attacks can be considered a federal crime under the <strong>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</strong>, and committing them can lead to years of imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to <em>Radware</em>, "2014 was a watershed year for the security industry," adding "cyber-attacks reached a tipping point in terms of quantity, length, complexity and targets."  Some notable security breaches this year included a (still unfolding) intrusion at <em>Sony Pictures</em>, a breach at <em>Target</em> that exposed data on more than 40 million debit and credit cards, and attacks that compromised information at companies such as <em>Home Depot</em>, <em>JPMorgan Chase</em>, <em>UPS</em> and <em>Dairy Queen</em>, just to name a few.  In nearly all of these incidents, the attackers somehow managed to remain undetected for weeks or even months.  What may be most troubling is that even these large corporations were unprepared for the attacks bestowed upon them.  The <em>Radware</em> survey found that less than half of the companies that took part were equipped to fight off cyberattacks for any period of time.  52% said they would be able to fight of an attack for a day at the most.  So what can be done to strengthen the security of these and other companies?
    </p>
    <p>
      First off, companies seem to be more and more willing to invest large amounts of money in improving their security.  While most companies are still unsure of exactly how much money it is going to take to completely shore up their security, nearly half of the companies involved in the <em>Radware</em> survey said that they had invested in new technologies to deal with cyberattacks.  In addition, many companies are now addressing security at a CEO level, or are appointing Chief Security Officers to their company to deal with such threats.  There are also an increasing number of companies today that deal exclusively with helping companies protect their information.  Conferences where employees from tech companies around the world can come and learn all about new and different security threats to their companies and how to prevent them are sprouting up all over the world.  One of the biggest of these conferences is called <em>Black Hat</em>, and it takes place in Las Vegas, Singapore, Amsterdam and Sao Paolo.  This conference is attended by representatives of government agencies and corporations, as well as hackers.  While these conferences have helped in stemming the tide against cyberattacks, with hackers finding newer and more powerful ways to carry out their attacks, tech companies must be constantly trying to adapt and stay ahead of the curve when it comes to security issues.
    </p> 
    <p>
      As long as there have been corporations, there have been security issues.  As companies contain more and more information crucial to their success, the need for security grows.  Thankfully, as the attacks increase in number, the awareness of the need for security increases as well.  The hope is that with the added personnel companies are devoting to this problem, along with the increasing number of security conferences such as <em>Black Hat</em>, the companies will eventually be able to outrun the hackers.
