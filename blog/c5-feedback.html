  <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2>
  <h3>You Get What You Give</h3>
  <h4>1-3-2015</h4>
    <p>
      At Dev Bootcamp, working well with others is such an important part of the culture.  Two ways in which this is implemented are <strong>pairing</strong> and <strong>feedback</strong>.  It is this idea that separates DBC from other immersion programs.  In this blog post, I am going to discuss the benefits of both pairing and feedback, which are great in number.  
    </p>
    <p>
      First, let's discuss <strong>pairing</strong>.  Pairing is the idea of working with another person to solve challenges, either in-person together or via an online method of communication, such as Skype, FaceTime or Google Hangout.  Pairing is stressed with extreme importance by DBC, to the level that it is required at least two times a week.  Pairing sessions are crucial to the development of any student.  Most of us in this program are beginners, and we all have different strengths and weaknesses.  By pairing with another student you can combine your strengths, and maybe the strengths of the person you are pairing with can counter your weaknesses.      
    </p>
    <p>
      For some pairing sessions, both students go into the session "blind", having not done any work yet on the challenge at hand.  When this is the case, one student begins as the <strong>driver</strong>, while the other begins as the <strong>navigator</strong>.  What this means, is that the driver is the one who writes the code, while the navigator does research and tells the driver what code to write.  It is expected that the driver and navigator roles will be swapped at some point during the pairing session, so that each person can experience both sides.  Sometimes, the roles can be switched back and forth several times during one session, but it is important that each person spends a significant amount of time in each role.
    </p>
    <p>
      For other pairing sessions, however, one student may have already completed some or all of the challenge, while the other student is just getting started.  In this case, it is possible that the student who has some of the challenge completed can copy and paste their code into a code-sharing site (such as Stypi) so that the other student can see what has been done so far and assist with refactoring.  Sometimes, a student can be working on a challenge for hours on end, completely stuck at a certain point.  Getting another pair of (fresh) eyes on the code can be a great help.  Someone who hasn't spent hours looking at the code might see something that the other student just completely missed.  
      
    </p>
    <p>
      It is even possible for two people who have both completed a challenge to still hold a pairing session.  There are always multiple ways to write code, and sharing completed challenges can teach you new and easier ways to write it.  In these sessions, there do not necessarily have to be defined driver and navigator roles, as the code is already written.  Instead, there is more of an open discussion of why certain pieces of code were written the way they were, and students can explain to each other their methods behind why they used certain code elements.  There is no right or wrong way to conduct a pairing session, and often it will depend on what the students are trying to get out the session.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, pairing has been incredibly beneficial.  There have been times where I am completely stuck on a challenge, and my partner in a pairing session has helped me get over the hump.  At the same time, there have been sessions where my partner is stuck, and my ability to help them figure out why they are stuck has been very reassuring to me.  Just being able to talk through a challenge with another person can be incredibly rewarding.  You may know exactly what you are TRYING to do, but you just can't figure out the steps to implement it.  By pairing with another person, you can tell them what you are trying to accomplish, and they may be able to help you accomplish it.  I can see how pairing can have a negative impact if your partner is not fully invested in the session.  Fortunately for me, this has not been the case in any session I have participated in.  The other students at DBC that I have worked with have been so helpful, and they never make me feel inadequate for needing help or further explanation on a topic.  Overall, pairing has been a crucial part of my development as a DBC student.
    </p> 
    <p>
      The other method that DBC uses to help their students is giving and receiving <strong>feedback</strong>.  Every time you take part in a pairing session, you are required to give your pairing partner feedback.  This feedback is incredibly important, because it lets you know what you are doing during your pairing sessions that is beneficial to your partner, as well as what you need to work on to ensure that your next pairing session runs as smoothly as possible.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, you can leave a pairing session feeling inadequate, like you did not bring as much to the table as your partner did.  Receiving feedback after a session like this is beneficial in multiple ways.  First, if your feelings of inadequacy are unfounded, the feedback given by your partner will reassure you that you are indeed bringing something to the table, and that can be a major morale boost after what you considered a poor session on your part.  On the other hand, if you did indeed have a sub-par pairing session, the feedback you receive could allow you to work on the things that you did poorly so that you can ensure that you improve those things before your next session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giving feedback is just as important as what you do with the feedback you receive.  After all, no one would be able to improve if they did not receive proper feedback from their partner.  When giving feedback, you want to make sure of three things.  You want your feedback to be <strong>actionable</strong>, <strong>specific</strong> and <strong>kind</strong>.  For feedback to be <strong>actionable</strong>, it must be something that the receiver can do something about.  You want to make suggestions that the person who receives the feedback can actually change.  To tell someone "I couldn't understand you with your accent", is not very actionable, because there isn't much that person can do about their accent.  On the other hand, to tell someone "I really couldn't hear you, it would be nice if you could speak up a little" is actionable, because that person could make a conscious effort to speak more loudly.  For feedback to be <strong>specific</strong>, it needs to be exactly that; specific.  This is pretty self-explanatory.  You wouldn't want to just say "great job with that pairing session!", because that is not very specific.  Instead, something like "great job with that pairing session!  You really helped me with my confusion about Classes, and you did great reminding us to switch driver and navigator roles!" would be much more specific.  Finally, you want your feedback to be <strong>kind</strong>.  An important distinction to make is that kindness does not necessarily equal niceness.  In this case, offering kind feedback is more about being honest.  You want to tell your partner how their actions in the pairing session affected you, rather than just whether it was "good" or "bad".       
    </p>

      Pairing and feedback are essential parts of the DBC experience.  It is these aspects that set DBC apart from other immersion programs.  Their focus on empathy is paramount to the success of their students.  Pairing and feedback can help a student reach the next level in their learning process, and it really keeps a student from feeling alone during the prep phase.  To know that there is always someone there willing to assist you and willing to give you feedback on what you are doing right and what you need to work on is a great feeling.  This is why I love Dev Bootcamp!
