  <h2>Learning New Ruby Methods</h2>
  <h3>I Want to Ride My .cycle</h3>
  <h4>12-14-2014</h4>
    <p>
      This week, we really got much more in-depth with some new Ruby methods.  The purpose of this blog post is to enlighten you to one of the new methods I learned.  Given the choice between three different methods, I decided to focus on the one that I was the least familiar with, so as to have an opportunity to learn more about it myself.  This method is called the <strong>.cycle</strong> method.
    </p>
    <p>
      This method is fairly straight-forward to understand and implement.  However, there are lots of different things you can do with the <strong>.cycle</strong> method.  Let's discuss the most simple usage first.  If you had an array of items (strings, integers, floats, etc.), and you want to print the entire list of items <em>x</em> amount of times, you can use <strong>.cycle</strong> to do this.  Let's see how this works: <pre><code>

                                                            sample_array = ["Colts", "Pacers", "Giants"]
                                                            sample_array.cycle(3) {|item| puts item}

                                                            Colts
                                                            Pacers
                                                            Giants
                                                            Colts
                                                            Pacers
                                                            Giants
                                                            Colts 
                                                            Pacers
                                                            Giants</code></pre>

      As you can see, we made a sample array that contained a list of our favorite sports teams (if you've read my previous blogs, you may notice a theme here...).  Then we called the <strong>.cycle</strong> method on our array, and told it to cycle through 3 times.  We followed our method with a code block (the part inside the {}), inside which we said that for each "item" in the array, we are going to puts that item on the screen.  One thing to be careful of, however, is that if you do not put a number after our method to tell it how many times to cycle through our array, then you will be left with an infinite loop of your items cycling through over and over again!
    </p>
    <p>
      So that's about as simple as the <strong>.cycle</strong> method gets, but there are many more things we can do with it.  What if we wanted to modify the items in our array for our cycle, but leave the original array the same?  You can call a method on the "item" in our code block to modify the items in the array.  For example, let's say we wanted to cycle through our array and return two loops where our items were in all caps, and two loops with the correct capitalization: <pre><code>

                                                            sample_array.cycle(2) {|item| puts item.upcase}
                                                            sample_array.cycle(2) {|item| puts item}

                                                            COLTS
                                                            PACERS
                                                            GIANTS
                                                            COLTS
                                                            PACERS
                                                            GIANTS
                                                            Colts
                                                            Pacers
                                                            Giants
                                                            Colts
                                                            Pacers
                                                            Giants</code></pre>

      Here you can see that our first cycle gave us two loops of our items in all caps, as we called the method <strong>.upcase</strong> on our items.  Then, when we called our second cycle, our items were back to normal with only the first letter in caps.  You can see another way this would work if our items were integers instead of strings: <pre><code>

                                                            int_array = [3, 4, 5]
                                                            int_array.cycle(2) {|int| puts int + 1}
                                                            int_array.cycle(2) {|int| puts int}

                                                            4
                                                            5
                                                            6
                                                            4
                                                            5
                                                            6
                                                            3
                                                            4
                                                            5
                                                            3
                                                            4
                                                            5</code></pre>

      In this case, for our first two cycles we added one to each item in the array.  Then for our second two cycles, we reverted back to the original array.  You can use any math method to alter the original array, but when you go back to calling for integer without a method (as we did in the second example), you will get the unmodified items from the original array returned to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that's what happens when we pass a code block to our <strong>.cycle</strong> method.  But what happens if we don't pass a code block?  If that's the case, then the result is an <strong>Enumerator</strong>.  Then, by using this enumerator, we can cycle through the items in our array one at a time by calling the method <strong>.next</strong>, and we can alter each one individually as we see fit by calling a method on them.  Confusing?  Take a look at this example using our sample_array from above: <pre><code>

                                                            sample_array = ["Colts", "Pacers", "Giants"]
                                                            cycle_enum = sample_array.cycle
                                                            puts cycle_enum.next
                                                            puts cycle_enum.next
                                                            puts cycle_enum.next
                                                            puts cycle_enum.next.upcase
                                                            puts cycle_enum.next.insert (0, "x")
                                                            puts cycle_enum.next.downcase

                                                            Colts
                                                            Pacers
                                                            Giants
                                                            COLTS
                                                            xPacers
                                                            giants</code></pre>

      We tried a few different things here to play around.  First, you can see that the first three times we called the <strong>.next</strong> method, we were returned the three items from our array in order.  The next time through, we tried calling different methods on each item.  First, we called <strong>.upcase</strong> on the first item, which returned "COLTS".  Then, we called <strong>.insert</strong> on our second item, and gave it the argument to insert an "x" in the "zeroth" slot (or the first slot, if you're not Ruby-inclined), which inserted an "x" before our item and gave us "xPacers".  Finally, we called <strong>.downcase</strong> on our final item, returning "giants".  This is the way to use the <strong>.cycle</strong> method if you want to change each individual item rather than all of the items as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are more ways to use the <strong>.cycle</strong> method, but for now I think that should be more than enough to cover in this blog post.  As we learn more in Phase 0, I will probably be discussing other methods in future blog posts that can be combined with <strong>.cycle</strong>.  For now, enjoy practicing what you (and I) have learned so far, and happy coding!
