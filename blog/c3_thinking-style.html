  <h2>What's My Thinking Style?</h2>
  <h3>The Only Style I've Got</h3>
  <h4>12-5-2014</h4>
    <p>
      Part of this week's curriculum was to consider my <em><strong>Gregorc Thinking Style</strong></em>.  There is a quiz you can take that will tell you which of four main thinking styles you fit with. (Want to take the quiz yourself? <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Take it here!</a>) Once you've taken the quiz, you can head over <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">here</a> to see what your results mean.  But this isn't about you, its about me (sorry).  
    </p>
    <p>
      So what's my thinking style?  Well, that's an interesting question.  I took this test right before I started DBC, and then I took it again today.  While my results were similar both times, they were not the same.  One thing I learned from taking the test twice, is that my thinking style is by FAR more abstract than concrete.  The first time I took the quiz, "abstract random" just barely edged out "abstract sequential", but they both were far ahead of either concrete result.  This time, it was the other way around with the two abstract categories, but as with the first time, the two abstract categories finished far ahead of either concrete category.  Interestingly, both times I took the quiz, I was fairly split down the middle between "random" and "sequential."

      OK, so what does this all mean?  Well, according to the theory behind this model, having the abstract quality "allows you to visualize, to conceive ideas, to understand or believe that which you cannot actually see. When you are using your abstract quality, you are using your intuition, your imagination, and you are looking beyond “what is” to the more subtle implications."  What?  I guess some of this describes me, but some of it is rather surprising to me.  I never considered myself to be someone who believes "that which you cannot actually see."  For example, I have always been a person of science rather than a person of faith.  I believe in what I know, what I can see, what has been proven.  While I have a vivid imagination, I do believe in the mantra "seeing is believing."  This seems to directly contradict my thinking style.  I guess maybe my thinking style is a bit more concrete than this quiz would have me believe.

      Let's apply my thinking style towards my experience with Dev Bootcamp thus far.  Some challenges that I've faced with DBC have come quite easily, while others have been more than difficult.  I haven't had or taken the time until now to sit and think WHY some challenges have been more difficult than others.  The challenges that seem to be more difficult for me involve more conceptualizing than just following steps to solve a problem.  This would lean towards a "concrete sequential" thinking style, which, strangely enough, was the style that received the lowest score from me on the quiz.  They say that "no one is a "pure" style. Each of us has a unique combination of natural strengths and abilities."  While I commented before that my abstract side dominated my concrete side according to the quiz, it wasn't a shutout.  I still have some concrete tendencies.  I'd say it is those tendencies that lean more towards the "logical" thought process that I find myself going through.  There are qualities associated with the abstract thinking style that I do find in myself.  Some of these qualities are "applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems", "bringing harmony to group situations" and "establishing healthy relationships with others".  There are also things that are typically difficult for someone with an abstract thinking style that are definitely difficult for me as well.  Some of these include "working with people who don’t seem friendly" (is anyone actually good at that?), "concentrating on one thing at a time" and having "too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly".  That last one is definitely something I plan on working on in the coming weeks.  I really need to "time-box" more (or make sure I don't go overboard on time spent on a specific problem or challenge).  I have found myself going down rabbit holes on challenges, and before I know it, eight hours may have passed and I haven't accomplished anything (other than growing more frustrated).  This is where knowing my thinking style will come in handy.  More than telling me how I think or what I'm good at, I'm more interested in improving the ways where I feel challenged.  This is good segue into the next topic I want to cover, which is "Growth vs Fixed Mindset".

    <p>
      To understand the difference between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset, first take a look at this chart...

      The basic definition of a fixed or growth mindset is that a person with a fixed mindset believes intelligence is static, which a growth mindset believes that intelligence can be developed.  I entered DBC with a mostly fixed mindset.  I believed that while KNOWLEDGE and INFORMATION can be gained, a person's INTELLIGENCE just is what it is.  After three weeks in this program, my mindset is definitely shifting towards that of a growth mindset.  Looking at the chart, I am trying to follow the path of the person with a growth mindset.  I am doing my best to embrace all challenges, not give up and learn from my criticism.  While I believe I am doing a good job at following that path, I still have the thought that I can't develop a higher level of intelligence.  This stems from the "impostor syndrome" that I still suffer from.  It has been a long time since I jumped into something with which I had as little experience as I do with programming.  This is a new and unusual (and somewhat uncomfortable) feeling for me, and I am doing my best to adapt to this new culture.  There are times, though, where I am tending to WAY overthink some challenges, and this is because of my belief that either I'm not smart enough to figure the material out, or that my brain can't work in the way it needs to in order to succeed in this industry.  This is where I get stuck in a fixed mindset.  Even if my "technical intelligence" is not where it needs to be right now, I have to believe in the growth mindset; the idea that my intelligence in this area CAN be developed and grow as I allow it to.

      Doing this exercise and putting my thoughts about the way I think "on paper" has opened my eyes to what I need to focus on in order to get the most out of Dev Bootcamp.  I need to eliminate the remaining thoughts of "impostor syndrome" that I have in order to full embrace the growth mindset.  When I do that, it will free my mind and allow it to fully embrace the plethora of new information that lies before me.
