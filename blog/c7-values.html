  <h2>Stereotype Threat - Part 2</h2>
  <h3>How Affirmations and Values Can Help</h3>
  <h4>1-17-2015</h4>
    <p>
      Last week, I shared with you what I learned about Stereotype Threat, how it can negatively affect someone's life and how I hoped to avoid it myself during my experience at Dev Bootcamp.  This week I am going to focus on how self-affirmation can help curb Stereotype Threat, and how recognizing values in yourself can be the first step to eradicating it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When exploring values that you find important for yourself, think of a time in your life when you've been the happiest, the proudest or the most satisfied.  What values come to mind when you think of this?  For me, I think back to a poker tournament that I won.  At the time, I was looking for vindication that I was a competent poker player, and that I could hold my own with some of the better players in my town.  I was trying to see if playing poker was something I could do to make a living.  While I had been playing well, it was going to take a big score to convince me that I had what it takes to do this on a daily basis and be profitable while doing so.  I had worked hard to try and improve my game, and I had been seeing the results at the table.  Then came a rather large tournament that I wanted to play in to see where my skills were at.  After hours of battling and a multitude of difficult decisions to make at the table, I came out victorious.  What was I feeling after this big moment in my life?  A few of the values I felt included accomplishment (this was the best result I had seen in a tournament), commitment (I had studied hard and put in many hours to improve my playing ability), confidence (this is one of the most important values to have in anything to set out to achieve) and economic security (many of the decisions we make in life are based on a desire to be able to support ourselves and our loved ones financially).     
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting back now and looking at these values, I can tell why they were such a big deal to me at the time.  While all important, I feel as though I do not do my best to live up to these values at all times.  First off, I need to recognize my accomplishments more than I recognize things that I have not accomplished.  This is an affirmation that I do not give myself often enough.  This has come to the forefront during Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp.  Too often over the past few weeks, I have spent too much time worrying about the things I have not accomplished as opposed to celebrating the things that I HAVE accomplished so far.  Recognizing my accomplishments could go a long way to eradicating the stereotype threat that I fear will engulf me as a programming newbie.  Looking at what I have learned and accomplished so far, and realizing how impossible much of it seemed just a few months ago, will help me feel as though I do belong at DBC and in the programming world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another value that I need to do a better job of living up to is commitment.  Throughout my life, I have found it difficult to commit to something that I find challenging.  There were definitely times where the challenge that DBC has presented me so far would have caused me to give up several times.  The fact that I have stuck with this through times where I felt incredibly frustrated and not even sure if this is what I want to do with my life shows me that I have grown in my level of commitment to things that are new or difficult.  Recognizing this new-found commitment can also be a boost to my eradication of stereotype threat, as it shows me that I indeed CAN stick with something when it proves challenging, something that will be necessary throughout the remainder of the DBC program.
    </p>
    <p>
      A value that goes hand in hand with the previous two is confidence.  The more I accomplish, and the more commitment I show to the program, the stronger my confidence will become.  Confidence is the biggest factor for me in stereotype threat.  If I don't have confidence, I am going to constantly feel like I don't belong at DBC.  This is where stereotype threat comes the most into play for me.  My fear is that everyone else is going to pick up the new information more quickly and easily than I am.  This also ties into the impostor syndrome that I mentioned last week.  I need to remember that most people in this program are at the same level as I am.  They are going through the same things I am, having the same thoughts and concerns that I am.  I need to use EVERY accomplishment I make to boost my confidence.  As my confidence grows, I know that my commitment to the program will grow as well.  It is in this way that my values all tie together to benefit my growth at DBC.  This leads to the final value I'm going to cover, which is economic security.
    </p>
    <p>
      Economic security is the main reason why I, and many others I'm assuming, am here.  I'm engaged to be married in the fall, and starting a family can't be too far behind.  I need to make sure that I am economically secure enough to be able to support a family, and in the Bay Area, that can be extremely difficult.  I have not been the best at saving money and being economically responsible throughout my life.  This, though, is what is driving me to succeed at DBC.  Every time things seem to be getting too difficult, and I just feel like giving up, I think about my fiance and my future family, and I know that I need to stay committed for them.  So now you can see how one value feeds another.  My desire to achieve economic security causes me to stay committed to DBC.  By staying committed, this helps me achieve new accomplishments that I never would have otherwise.  All of these new accomplishments add to my confidence, which will allow me to be a better developer.  The better I become at development, the more economic security I should find in my career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognizing your values and what is important to you can help wipe out stereotype threat.  By achieving these values, you can receive a higher level of self-affirmation.  The more you believe in yourself, the more you can achieve.  It is a cycle that can lead to success in any field you choose to pursue, from poker to web development and everything in between.
