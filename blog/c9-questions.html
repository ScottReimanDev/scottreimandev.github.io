  <h2>Facing My Fear</h2>
  <h3>You Can't Be Afraid to Ask!</h3>
  <h4>1-28-2015</h4>
    <p>
      One of the most important aspects of Dev Bootcamp is being able to ask questions when you don't know the answer to something.  This is going to happen A LOT.  There is going to be so much new information coming in, that it is inevitable that we are going to be confused about some things.  The ability to ask questions not only fills in the gaps where your knowledge is incomplete, but it also shows initiative to want to learn new things.  This is, without a doubt, something that I know I need to work on.  I have long associated asking questions with being inferior.  If you ask questions, then that shows that you don't know the answer to something, which means you are inferior to someone who does know the answer and therefore does not need to ask questions.  I also have to get over the fear of being judged for the question that I ask.  I may assume that something that I am having difficulty with is difficult for all, when that may be far from the case.  If I show that I am having difficulty with something that everyone else is completing with ease, then, to me, this is shown as a sign of weakness.  Nothing has happened thus far in Phase 0 to show me that anyone at DBC thinks this way, in fact, it has been quite the opposite.  Everyone has been so supportive, and everyone seems to be on the same page.  This has helped ease my fears about asking questions, and I have been able to open up more inquisitively than I ever have before.

      Now that I'm more comfortable asking questions, I need to think about how to phrase them in order to receive the kind of answers that I'm looking for.  If a question does not get answered by the responses it garners, then asking it has no purpose in the first place.  So what makes a good question?  There are some things you need to think about before you even ask or post the question.  First off, you want your question to be succinct, spelled correctly with proper grammer and easy to understand.  Make sure you include details that will help someone identify and solve your problem.  If your question has to do with code that you've already written, make sure you include that code with your question so that others know exactly where your problem is and can answer accordingly.  You want the people responding to your question to be able to reproduce the problem, basically putting themselves in your place to try and help you find a solution.

      Now that you're ready to ask or post your question on a bulletin board, go ahead and ask/post it!  Because when you ask someone a question directly, you get their answer directly, these next steps will only be applicable if you are posting the question on a bulletin board or website.  Once you post your question, leave it open in your browser for a bit to see if anyone responds straight away.  Be ready with additional information should someone request it to help them answer your question.  If someone posts an answer, be ready to try out their suggestion and see if it works.  If it does, let that person know that they helped you solve your problem!  If it doesn't, let them know that you gave it a try, it didn't work, what happened and see if they have any suggestions as to why their solution was not successful.

      As I look at some of the questions I asked my fellow DBC cohort members throughout Phase 0, I was lucky enough to receive the answer I was looking for in most situations.  There was one case recently, though, where I was unable to find the solution to my problem.  I went through several steps to try and find the answer without ever coming to a full conclusion.  The question sprang from my desire to make a certain kind of game using JavaScript.  I could not figure out how to prompt a player for input and then store that input in the program for use later in the game.  I did hours of research, unsuccessfully.  I finally decided to post my question on the Google+ DBC board.  I posed the question in as succinct of a way as I could, I tried to use technical terms where necessary and I let people know what I had tried, what worked and what didn't.  I received lots of feedback; some helpful, some not.  Some suggested I try something that I already had tried, some people replied to let me know they had the same question (which is a re-assuring positive of asking questions) and some people gave me advice that, while not solving my problem completely, moved me in the right direction closer to a solution.  Since I did not get my answer by posting my question, I decided to attend DBC office hours to see if a staff member could help me.  As with when I posted my question, I tried to be as succinct and yet descriptive as I could.  Again, I did not come up with a solution from office hours, but instead was nudged further in the right direction.  After putting in more time than I had planned for this challenge, I decided to scrap my original plan and go with something a little simpler.  I was disappointed that I was not able to complete my initial project, but I was pleased with myself for putting in the effort by asking questions to try and get it solved.  I said as much in the reflection portion of the challenge.  When I received feedback from the DBC staff on this challenge, my marks were very high.  I was told that the fact that I asked questions and kept trying to find the solution was as important as finding the solution itself.  That was a big moment for me.  It finally hit me why asking questions was so important, especially in this industry.  You learn so much from the exploration process.  So often when coding, you hit a wall and have to search for the right answer.  The more experience you have in knowing how to search for the answer, the better results you will have.  I'm learning more and more about this process every day, and I'm so excited to be moving on to Phase 1!
