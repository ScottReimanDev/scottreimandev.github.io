  <h2>Dealing With Conflict</h2>
  <h3>It Happens to Us All</h3>
  <h4>1-24-2015</h4>
    <p>
      Conflict is something that everyone in this world deals with in one way or another.  From large external conflicts, like war and protesting, to small internal conflicts, like what to wear or what to have for breakfast, everyone has something that they are conflicted about.  One of the keys to eliminating, or at least reducing conflict in your life, is to be able to analyze the situation and break it down to its most basic level.  Upon doing this, you can realize why the conflict made you feel this way, and what you can do to help avoid it in the future.  I'm going to use an example of a conflict I had in my life to show how breaking it down helped me avoid it in the future.

      Before I started training to be a web developer, I worked in sports radio for five years.  I entered the field as a 30 year old intern, which, coupled with my eagerness and desire to move up in the industry, got me a leg up on my fellow interns.  I was offered opportunities over them, that while unpaid, were great experiences and allowed me to show my dedication and passion to the field.  As a couple of years passed, though, I noticed that I was not progressing as much as I was hoping.  I would approach my boss about this and ask what I could do in order to move my career along, and I was always told that I just had to keep doing what I was doing and opportunities would open up.  Thus began a conflict that I would face for the next several years.  I loved my job, but I couldn't stay there forever in the position I was in for the pay I was receiving.  There were many times that I wanted to leave, but I didn't.  I decided to stick it out, always "just a little longer", to see if anything progressed.

      I felt many different emotions during this conflict.  I was angry, I was confused and I was disappointed, both in my company and in myself.  I would often analyze these emotions and try to convince myself that it was worth it to stay at it, keep going, and that it would all pay off in the end.  I tried to take on added responsibilities and learn new skills to show that I was truly dedicated to the field.  Unfortunately, this only made the conflict grow, as these added measures did nothing to move my career along in the field of sports radio.  I was constantly balancing the conflict I felt at work and the emotions it sprung up inside me with the highs of the industry.  I knew this was where I wanted to be, so I was willing to put up with the conflict and emotions that the conflict came with.  That would not always be the case.

      After being in the sports radio industry for over five years, I was still a part-time employee making not more than minimum wage.  I had lived some of the most amazing experiences of my life, including being in the SF Giants Clubhouse interviewing the players after the World Series and getting to interview Giants starting pitcher Matt Cain after he pitched a perfect game, but I could not keep working there as a part-time employee.  When I began in the industry, I was a 30 year old single man, and I did not have to make much money in order to support myself.  After five years, I was a 35 year old engaged man, and the prospect of a family was not too far down the road.  I couldn't take the "just a little longer" approach anymore.  I revisited this conflict, and realized that it was not worth it anymore.  As much as I loved what I did, the benefit did not outweigh the downside anymore.

      This shows how circumstances in your life can determine how you view conflict and what steps you take to resolve it.  When I only had myself to think about, I was willing to put up with the conflict and negative emotions that came with it.  Once I had to think more about my future and not just my present, it became clear to me that I needed to resolve this conflict, and the only way that was going to happen was to move on from the sports radio industry and find a field that interested me just as much, one where I could support not only myself, but a family as well.  If I could go back, I'm not sure exactly what I would change.  I am still eternally grateful for the experiences I had working in sports radio, and I would not give them up for anything in the world (well, almost anything).  I do feel, however, that the decisions I made may have come later than they needed to.  If I had analyzed my emotions earlier, and realized what the source of the conflict truly was (that I was not going to advance my career enough to stay in the sports radio field), then I could have made the decision to change fields earlier in my life.  I don't have any regrets, though, and I believe that everything that happened to me in my five years in radio only made me stronger and helped me prepare for this next phase in my life.
