  <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
  <h3>What Can I Do About It?</h3>
  <h4>1-10-2015</h4>
    <p>
      This week, I learned about a concept that I was not familiar with.  This concept is called <strong><em>Stereotype Threat</em></strong>.  Stereotype threat is a situation where people of a certain ethnicity or social group have a fear of confirming the stereotypes associated with that group.  This leads to reduced performance by the individual on things such as tests and performance in the workplace.  Stereotype threat can be very dangerous, because when people assume their stereotypes will define them, they have a harder time breaking out of those stereotypes.  People need to believe that they can change the stereotype in order to be able to actually do it.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Stereotype threat isn't something that I've encountered too much in my life.  As a straight caucasian male, many of the stereotypes that affect a person of color or of a different sexual orientation have not affected me.  That is not to say that I have not been affected by stereotypes.  I have defintely been stereotyped as a Jew before.  I can't think of any situation where the Jewish stereotype has affected me negatively, however.  Perhaps its because I let it just slide off my shoulders and didn't really think twice about it.  Another stereotype I encountered was go to college coming from an affluent town.  Many people just assumed upon meeting me that I acted a certain way or thought a certain way, when it couldn't have been further from the truth.  Again, though, I never let affect me in a negative way.  It may have upset me some, but I never let it affect my school or work performance.     
    </p>
    <p>
      While I'd like to say I can imagine what's like to have stereotype threat negatively affect my life, I'm not sure I can.  I understand the logic behind it, but I can't imagine what its like to have to deal with the affect of negative stereotypes every day.  I have worked with elementary school children from low income areas who deal with it daily, and I've seen how it can affect them.  It appears that many of them think that they can only accomplish as much as is expected of them, and nothing more.  In many cases, this thought is ever perpetuated by their parents.  I saw many parents who did not expect as much from their children as they should.  This is where stereotype threat can penetrate throughout generations, and it is a cycle that needs to be broken.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the biggest way the cycle of stereotype threat can be broken is through reassurance.  It is everyone's responsibility to ensure that members of groups who face negative stereotypes understand that they can break the cycle.  This is something I tried to do when working with children.  I wanted them to believe in themselves, to believe that even though people, maybe even their parents, tell them that they should behave a certain way or act a certain way because of their ethnicity or race, that they don't have to act that way.  Sometimes people are told things so often that they start to believe it, whether there is truth in it or not.

      As I enter Phase 1 of Dev Bootcamp, I am hoping not to experience any stereotype threat myself.  I'm afraid this may be inevitable, however.  I am not the typical web developer.  I was (and still am, to some extent) a jock.  I'm still very into sports, and before getting into development, I worked in sports radio.  I had zero development experience heading into DBC, and although I know many people were in the same boat, I couldn't help but feeling a little <strong><em>impostor syndrome</em></strong>.  Impostor syndrome is a feeling of not belonging, a feeling that everyone else is having more success than you, a feeling that you shouldn't be doing what you're doing.  The fact that I am not the typical web developer has given me some impostor syndrome.  There have definitely been times throughout Phase 0 where I have felt as though I don't belong.  Sometimes I question whether or not I made the right decision trying to enter this field.  I'm hoping that once I arrive at the DBC campus and meet everyone in the program, and I realize that we are not that different, then the impostor syndrome will vanish, or least shrink.  I just need to have faith in myself, and believe that if anyone can do this, I can!
