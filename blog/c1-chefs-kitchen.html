  <h2>DBC Fireside Chat</h2>
  <h3>Am I a Chef or a Diner?</h3>
  <h4>11-21-2014</h4>
  
    <p>
      I just finished watching the entire Fireside Chat with Shareef, and I loved what I saw.  This is the reason why I chose DBC over the other bootcamps that are out there (I love how Shareef referred to the majority of the other bootcamps as a "joke"). I love the tenets that DBC runs on.  It is this type of culture that I thrive in the best.  The idea of cameraderie between classmates, that everyone is in this together, one for all and all for one; that all really appeals to me.  I know there are going to be moments where I need to lean on one of my cohort mates for something, and I'm hoping that they will view me as someone that they can lean on as well.

        I remember the "kitchen vs restaurant" analogy from one of the videos I watched before applying, and it really resonated with me.  There was a time when my mindset was definitely that of the "restaurant" viewpoint.  In high school and even college, I expected to go to class and have the information force-fed to me for later regurgitation.  DBC has taught me that learning new information is a two-way street.  You can't expect to be able to just take in the information that is taught and store it so that you can use it later. We are not just classmates, we are a team.  Everyone has to take partial responsibility in the learning and development of others, and if we do that, we will all be better off in the long run.

        I have been nervous from the beginning that I was going to be behind most of the people in the class.  Now I know that this will not be the case.  There will be plenty of other beginners like myself, as well as people who are more advanced.  We will all be able to teach each other something.  While someone who is more technologically advanced than myself might be able to teach me things I didn't know in that realm, I may be able to teach them something culturally about different ways to learn that they hadn't thought about before.  Everyone in this program has something to offer, and that's an important thing to remember.  I am doing my best to expose and embrace my ignorance, something I've had trouble doing in the past.  I always felt like I needed to prove that I knew things that I actually didn't, and that won't work here.  There is so much that I don't know, and if I don't expose that and ask for help, then I won't be able to get anywhere in DBC.
    </p>

        All of this being said, I could not be more excited to continue my prep work and learn everything I can before beginning Phase 1.  I know it is going to be a bumpy road with lots of ups and downs, but if we all stay focused on what we need to accomplish and concentrate on the best ways to get us to our destination, it will help make the ride as smooth as possible.
