        <h3>What is Pair Programming?</h3>
        <p>Pair Programming is essentially a methodology in which we combine the resources of two individuals in order to provide a better product, in terms of code.  Two people coding can get on a Google Hangout, Stypi file or other method of collaboration in order to code a project together or work on a challenge.</p>
        <h3>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h3>
        <p>It's important in our learning process because we can see answers to questions that we might not have addressed otherwise.  Pair programming can also help alleviate impostor syndrome, as you discover that others are encountering the same issues as you are.</p>
        <h3>Comparing Driver and Navigator Roles</h3>
        <p>In pair programming, the driver is the person who is doing the actual coding, while the navigator is the person who is dictating the code.  Its important to define these roles so that the pairing session runs smoothly and efficiently.</p>
