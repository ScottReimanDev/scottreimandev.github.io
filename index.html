  			<h3>Welcome to my website!</h3>
  			<p>Glad you could stop by! You are now a part of my journey from sports radio producer and programming ignoramus to web developing genius.  Unfortunately, I'm still closer to the former than the latter.  As my weeks at Dev Bootcamp go by, I am hoping to see a gradual shift toward the genius end, though!  Throughout the nine week prep phase (Phase 0), I will be updating this site with my blog posts and possibly with upcoming projects that I will be working on.  Stay tuned!</p>
  			<p>Right now, this is still all new to me.  I am learning more and more every day, and some things are coming more easily than others.  It will be fun to see how this website changes and (hopefully) improves from week to week.  Who knows, by the end of the nine weeks it may even look somewhat professional!  Until then, bear with me and try to enjoy the journey as much as I am!</p>
